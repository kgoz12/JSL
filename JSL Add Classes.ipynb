If a colour is inadvertantly smudged the damage can aften be repaired; use a razor blade to scratch away the smear and then very carefully fill in again with the paint brush. Where a slipped surface is chipped or otherwise marked the piece at this stage will be too dry to correct with slip, and one can either try and make good straightaway with the nearest available pottery colour or wait until after the biscuit firing and use colour before dipping the piece in glaze.'],\n",
